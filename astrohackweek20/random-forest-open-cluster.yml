description: > Code to verify if a collection of stars found in the Gaia database is an open cluster.
Clustering algorithms (e.g. DBSCAN) returns tens of cluster candidates for every few square degrees
of the sky area when they are applied to the Gaia DR2 database data. In reality some of these cluster 
candidates are not open clusters but rather are fluctuations of the Galactic disk stellar population.
These collections of stars are expected to have very different ages, absorptions and metallicities. 
In this repository we train random forest and convolutional neural network to distiungush between 
actual open cluster and general Galactic disk population.
